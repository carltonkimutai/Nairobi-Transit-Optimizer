    "# NOTEBOOK 01: SOCIO-ECONOMIC SPATIAL EXTRACTION\r\n",
    "**Objective:** To extract, classify, and mathematically weight Nairobi's workforce (Origins) and employment centers (Destinations) to build a highly accurate, socio-economic urban transit model.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## PHASE 1: JOB CENTER EXTRACTION (THE DESTINATIONS)\r\n",
    "Real-world urban transit requires precise targeting of actual economic zones, not abstract mathematical clusters. We divide Nairobi's employment hubs into two distinct destinations based on the city's decentralized economic reality:\r\n",
    "1. **Corporate / White-Collar Hubs:** The formal economy—administrative, financial, tech centers, and diplomatic zones.\r\n",
    "2. **Industrial & Soko / Blue-Collar Hubs:** The manual and wholesale economy—manufacturing corridors, logistics hubs, and massive open-air markets.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Using the `osmnx` library, we dynamically connect to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database to extract the exact geographic center-points (centroids) of these specific economic engines."
